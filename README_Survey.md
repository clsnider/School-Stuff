Hello and welcome to the README for the Survey application! This application was developed iteratively as a project for a JAVA
programming class. It includes a Survey class, which stores all of the behaviors expected of a survey, a Survey Test class which
was used to test the Survey class during development, and a Survey Conductor class, which contains the main method of the project.

The source files are stored in "CSnider_IT152_IP5/src/Survey". 

Survey contains a pair of arrays. One is a String array that is used for storing the questions that will be in the survey, while 
the other one is a two-dimensional array that holds each of 10 respondents' answers to the survey questions. Also included are
methods for displaying the results of the survey in a clear and readable manner, along with methods for displaying the results
of individual questions as well as the questions that received the highest overall ratings and the lowest overall ratings.
